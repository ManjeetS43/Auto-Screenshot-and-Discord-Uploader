# Auto-Screenshot-and-Discord-Uploader
This Python script automatically captures screenshots every 10 seconds, saves them in date-based folders, and uploads them to a Discord channel via a webhook. The screenshots are timestamped for easy tracking. The script can run invisibly in the background and be set to start automatically on boot, ideal for monitoring or logging tasks.
